## ðŸš€ About Me

I am an aspiring Aerospace Engineer with a passion for space exploration and sustainable technology, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. As the Co-Founder of E Zip-N-Zoom, I have gorwn my skills in business management, operations, and customer service while promoting innovative electric vehicle solutions. My time with Shop Tools Outlet and E Zip-N-Zoom has allowed me to get real hands-on experience with deadlines, technological integration, and customer engagement. 

I am eager to apply my strong analytical, problem-solving, and teamwork skills to the aerospace industry, contributing to cutting-edge projects and advancing my knowledge in the field. I am particularly interested in space missions, vehicle design, and propulsion technologies.

In my free time you can find me out snowboarding, hitting the gym, or learning new skills like programming!
